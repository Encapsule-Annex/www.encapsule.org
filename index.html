      <p>
	Encapsule Project is an open source effort to apply concepts from digital circuit design to the specification and synthesis of complex software systems.
      </p>
      <p>
	Fundamentally, digital hardware and software systems are manifestations of
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine" title="Turing Machine article on Wikipedia" target="_blank">Turing Machine</a> models.
	Systems comprised of digital hardware plus software (e.g. whatever you're reading this text on) are themselves ultimately Turing Machines.
	Yet despite their common mathematical roots, digital hardware and software engineering are radically different fields of endeavor.
      </p>
      <p>
	To understand why this is consider that hardware systems must be physically realized via a complex, time consuming, and extremely
	expensive manufacturing process. Software by contrast does not. A bug in a chip or circuit board spells doom for a product and the
	company that produced it. By contrast, a bug in a software system isn't considered that big a deal because it can be fixed, and an
	update issued at "low cost" and little customer impact.
      </p>
<p>
So of economic necessity, the hardware industry has always had to get it nearly 100% right before going to market whereas the software industry
has traditionally played fast and loose largely ignoring formal design verification, simulation, and IP re-use strategies. Design it quickly,
implement it well enough, ship it, and patch it later is the software mantra. That used to work.
</p>










        I've been actively working on a web-based editing application for Soft Circuit Description Language (SCDL) models. SCDL (pronounced "scuddle") is a JSON object model for "soft circuits." Soft circuits are system design artifacts conceptually analogous to digital circuit schematics.




<p>
The application is called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schema" title="Schema on Wikipedia">Schema</a> and should be online and functional sometime late in February, 2013.
</p>
<p>
</p>
      <p>
        In addition to being a cool HTML5 demo, I am excited about the SCDL editor because SCDL models are <i>machine-readable</i> system specifications that can be used like blueprints.
      </p>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Quickly 'gist' SCDL models and share via GitHub.</li>
          <li>Interpret SCDL at runtime. (e.g. in Javascript in a generic host implemented in Javascript)</li>
          <li>Transform SCDL to something else and compile or interpret that. (e.g. a SCDL model can be transformed into a C++ meta program).</li>
          <li>Leverage SCDL for system simulation, verification, and test automation.</li>
        </ul>
